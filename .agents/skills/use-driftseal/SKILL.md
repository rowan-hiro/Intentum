description: Follow DriftSeal-managed repository work when AGENTS.md requires `driftseal`, the user invokes DriftSeal, or an interrupted outcome must be resumed. Use this skill to locate the authoritative repository policy, re-anchor state after context loss, and choose the execution surface; prefer the `driftseal` CLI, using MCP only when the repository or user explicitly selects it.

# Use DriftSeal

Treat the target repository's applicable `AGENTS.md` as the source of truth.
This skill helps locate and resume that workflow; it does not restate or extend
the policy.

## Locate DriftSeal

- Read the applicable `AGENTS.md` before making changes.
- Prefer `driftseal` from `PATH`. In a DriftSeal source checkout, fall back to
  `node bin/driftseal.js`.
- Use an explicitly configured, repository-pinned MCP server only when the user
  or repository selects it, or when shell execution is unavailable. Its tool
  schemas, not `driftseal help`, define the MCP interface.
- Use one interface consistently within a round.
- If DriftSeal is unavailable, limit activity to read-only discovery and report
  the blocker. Do not mutate the repository without the required log.

## Re-anchor When Needed

After context loss or when outcome state is uncertain, run:

```sh
driftseal status
driftseal log --last 3
```

Then resume, extend, replace, verify, or close the outcome exactly as
`AGENTS.md` requires. Use `extend` only when the additional work still delivers
the same coherent outcome. `status` and `log --last 3` follow the current lane;
an open outcome stays visible even if it belongs to another lane. If the
requested work belongs to a different existing lane, switch first. For
command syntax, run:

```sh
driftseal help
```

## After a merge

If `status` or `log` fails with a duplicate id or with `multiple outcomes in
progress`, or the outcome log has conflict markers, or Git stops because
decision ids or Decision History need worktree repair, run `driftseal absorb`
instead of editing `.seal/outcomes/events.jsonl`. A merge can leave the log
healthy while MADR Decision History still quotes pre-merge outcome ids; `absorb`
(and `absorb --dry-run`) repairs those references even when ids are already
unique. When both sides still have an
open outcome, add `--abandon-theirs` or `--abandon-ours`; this works whether your
open outcome sits in the log or is parked beside the WAL. `driftseal init` also
configures the local git merge driver; clones need `init` again for that driver.

In a default Git-repository seal, `begin` parks beside the WAL and does not dirty
the tracked outcome log, so `git merge` can run with an outcome still in
progress. Custom `$DRIFTSEAL_HOME` seals write that open outcome directly to
`events.jsonl`. `end` writes the closed record to `.seal/outcomes/events.jsonl`;
if it is interrupted, the outcome stays open there and `end` can be run again.

For a v1 repository, do not reinterpret or delete the old logs directly. Use
`driftseal migrate v1-to-v2 inspect`, prepare a reviewed grouping plan, apply
it, and run `check`. Migration stages `.seal/` beside v1 and never removes the
old paths; their removal requires explicit user approval.

Do not treat this skill, MCP descriptions, or lifecycle-hook reminders as
additional policy. If they conflict with `AGENTS.md`, follow `AGENTS.md`.
